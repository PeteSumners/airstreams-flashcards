## About Anki

Anki is **free and open source** software:
- Website: https://apps.ankiweb.net/
- Source code: https://github.com/ankitects/anki
- License: AGPL v3

Anki uses **spaced repetition** - a proven learning technique that shows you cards:
- More frequently when you're learning them
- Less frequently as you master them
- Right before you're about to forget them

This is scientifically proven to be the most efficient way to memorize information!

## Good Luck!

You're all set for your OSHA 10HR Construction Training!
