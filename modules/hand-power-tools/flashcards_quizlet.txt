POWER TOOLS - TYPES BY POWER SOURCE
POWER TOOLS - TYPES BY POWER SOURCE
================================================================================
What are the five types of power tools determined by their power source?	Electric; pneumatic; liquid fuel; hydraulic; powder-actuated.
What must power tools be fitted with?	Guards and safety switches.
Are power tools dangerous when used improperly?	Extremely hazardous when used improperly.
What are the two types of switches for hand-held power tools?	Constant pressure switch (shuts off power upon release; examples: circular saw, chain saw, grinder, hand held power drill); on-off switch (examples: routers, planers, laminate trimmers, shears, jig saws, nibblers, scroll saws).
What are seven precautions when using power tools?	Disconnect tools when not in use, before servicing and cleaning, and when changing accessories; keep people not involved with the work away from the work; secure work with clamps or a vise, freeing both hands to operate the tool; don't hold the switch button while carrying a plugged-in tool; keep tools sharp and clean; consider what you wear (loose clothing and jewelry can get caught in moving parts); remove damaged electric tools and tag them "Do Not Use".
What are four precautions for electric cords on power tools?	Don't carry portable tools by the cord; don't use electric cords to hoist or lower tools; don't yank cord or hose to disconnect it; keep cords and hoses away from heat, oil, and sharp edges.
What are three ways to protect a worker from shock with electric power tools?	Have a 3-wire cord plugged into a grounded receptacle; be double insulated; be powered by a low-voltage isolation transformer.
What are six best practices when using electric tools?	Operate within design limits; use gloves and safety shoes; store in a dry place; don't use in wet locations unless approved for that; work areas well lit; ensure cords don't present a tripping hazard.



================================================================================
ABRASIVE WHEELS AND TOOLS - GUARDS
ABRASIVE WHEELS AND TOOLS - GUARDS
================================================================================
What must abrasive wheels and tools be equipped with?	Guards that cover the spindle end, nut, and flange projections; maintain proper alignment with the wheel; don't exceed the strength of the fastenings.
How should abrasive wheels be inspected before mounting?	Inspect closely for damage; perform sound- or ring-test to ensure free from cracks/defects.
How do you test an abrasive wheel for cracks?	Tap wheel gently with a light, non-metallic instrument. If wheel sounds cracked or dead, do not use it because it could fly apart.
What are six safety precautions when using abrasive wheels?	Fit the wheel on the spindle freely; tighten the spindle nut enough to hold the wheel in place without distorting the flange; let the tool come up to speed prior to grinding or cutting; don't stand in front of the wheel as it comes up to full speed; use eye and/or face protection; ensure the spindle speed doesn't exceed the maximum speed marked on the wheel.
How far should work rests be kept from the wheel surface?	Keep work rests not more than 1/8th inch from wheel surface.
Why is it important to keep work rests close to the wheel?	This prevents jamming the work between the wheel and the rest, which may cause the wheel to break.
Should you adjust the wheel while it's rotating?	Don't adjust wheel while it's rotating.



================================================================================
GUARDING - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
GUARDING - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================
What parts of power tools must be guarded?	Exposed moving parts of power tools; belts, gears, shafts, pulleys, sprockets, spindles, flywheels, chains, or other moving parts.
Should you remove a guard when a tool is in use?	Never remove a guard when a tool is in use.
What is the point of operation?	The point of operation is where the work is performed on the materials. It must be guarded.
What four hazards must machine guards protect the operator and others from?	Point of operation; in-running nip points; rotating parts; flying chips and sparks.



================================================================================
PNEUMATIC TOOLS
PNEUMATIC TOOLS
================================================================================
What is the main hazard of pneumatic tools?	Getting hit by a tool attachment or by a fastener the worker is using with the tool.
What precautions should be taken with air hoses on pneumatic tools?	Take the same precautions with an air hose that you take with electric cords.
What types of tools are pneumatic tools?	Powered by compressed air. Includes nailers, staplers, chippers, drills, and sanders.
How should pneumatic tools be fastened to the hose?	Ensure tool is fastened securely to the hose to prevent a disconnection.
What device should be used to attach the air hose to pneumatic tools?	Use a short wire or positive locking device attaching the air hose to the tool.
When must a safety device be placed on the muzzle of a pneumatic tool?	Place a safety device on the muzzle to prevent the tool from ejecting fasteners, unless the muzzle is in contact with work surface.
What should be installed to prevent ejection from pneumatic tools?	Install a safety clip or retainer to prevent attachments, such as chisels on a chipping hammer, from being ejected.
What PPE is required for pneumatic tools?	Wear eye protection and hearing protection with jackhammers.
Is compressed air allowed for cleaning?	Do not use compressed air for cleaning.
What is the exception for using compressed air for cleaning?	Exception: where pressure is reduced to less than 30 psi with effective chip guarding and PPE.
