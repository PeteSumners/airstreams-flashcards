Q: What are the three main hazard categories for workers using hand and power tools?
A: Objects that fall, fly, are abrasive, or splash; harmful dusts, fumes, mists, vapors, and gases; frayed or damaged electrical cords, hazardous connections, and improper grounding.

Q: What are the six basic tool safety practices?
A: Maintain regularly; use right tool for the job; inspect before use; operate according to manufacturer's instructions; use the right personal protective equipment (PPE); use guards.

Q: What usually causes hand tool hazards?
A: Misuse and improper maintenance.

Q: Why are hand tool hazards difficult to spot?
A: May be difficult to spot due to familiarity.

Q: What hand tools should not be used? (List 4)
A: Wrenches when jaws are sprung; impact tools (chisels and wedges) when heads have mushroomed; tools with loose, cracked or splintered handles; screwdrivers as a chisels.

Q: What are three protection measures when using hand tools?

================================================================================
POWER TOOLS - TYPES BY POWER SOURCE
POWER TOOLS - TYPES BY POWER SOURCE
================================================================================

Q: What are the five types of power tools determined by their power source?
A: Electric; pneumatic; liquid fuel; hydraulic; powder-actuated.

Q: What must power tools be fitted with?
A: Guards and safety switches.

Q: Are power tools dangerous when used improperly?
A: Extremely hazardous when used improperly.

Q: What are the two types of switches for hand-held power tools?
A: Constant pressure switch (shuts off power upon release; examples: circular saw, chain saw, grinder, hand held power drill); on-off switch (examples: routers, planers, laminate trimmers, shears, jig saws, nibblers, scroll saws).

Q: What are seven precautions when using power tools?
A: Disconnect tools when not in use, before servicing and cleaning, and when changing accessories; keep people not involved with the work away from the work; secure work with clamps or a vise, freeing both hands to operate the tool; don't hold the switch button while carrying a plugged-in tool; keep tools sharp and clean; consider what you wear (loose clothing and jewelry can get caught in moving parts); remove damaged electric tools and tag them "Do Not Use".

Q: What are four precautions for electric cords on power tools?
A: Don't carry portable tools by the cord; don't use electric cords to hoist or lower tools; don't yank cord or hose to disconnect it; keep cords and hoses away from heat, oil, and sharp edges.

Q: What are three ways to protect a worker from shock with electric power tools?
A: Have a 3-wire cord plugged into a grounded receptacle; be double insulated; be powered by a low-voltage isolation transformer.

Q: What are six best practices when using electric tools?
A: Operate within design limits; use gloves and safety shoes; store in a dry place; don't use in wet locations unless approved for that; work areas well lit; ensure cords don't present a tripping hazard.



================================================================================
ABRASIVE WHEELS AND TOOLS - GUARDS
ABRASIVE WHEELS AND TOOLS - GUARDS
================================================================================

Q: What must abrasive wheels and tools be equipped with?
A: Guards that cover the spindle end, nut, and flange projections; maintain proper alignment with the wheel; don't exceed the strength of the fastenings.

Q: How should abrasive wheels be inspected before mounting?
A: Inspect closely for damage; perform sound- or ring-test to ensure free from cracks/defects.

Q: How do you test an abrasive wheel for cracks?
A: Tap wheel gently with a light, non-metallic instrument. If wheel sounds cracked or dead, do not use it because it could fly apart.

Q: What are six safety precautions when using abrasive wheels?
A: Fit the wheel on the spindle freely; tighten the spindle nut enough to hold the wheel in place without distorting the flange; let the tool come up to speed prior to grinding or cutting; don't stand in front of the wheel as it comes up to full speed; use eye and/or face protection; ensure the spindle speed doesn't exceed the maximum speed marked on the wheel.

Q: How far should work rests be kept from the wheel surface?
A: Keep work rests not more than 1/8th inch from wheel surface.

Q: Why is it important to keep work rests close to the wheel?
A: This prevents jamming the work between the wheel and the rest, which may cause the wheel to break.

Q: Should you adjust the wheel while it's rotating?
A: Don't adjust wheel while it's rotating.



================================================================================
GUARDING - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
GUARDING - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Q: What parts of power tools must be guarded?
A: Exposed moving parts of power tools; belts, gears, shafts, pulleys, sprockets, spindles, flywheels, chains, or other moving parts.

Q: Should you remove a guard when a tool is in use?
A: Never remove a guard when a tool is in use.

Q: What is the point of operation?
A: The point of operation is where the work is performed on the materials. It must be guarded.

Q: What four hazards must machine guards protect the operator and others from?
A: Point of operation; in-running nip points; rotating parts; flying chips and sparks.



================================================================================
PNEUMATIC TOOLS
PNEUMATIC TOOLS
================================================================================

Q: What is the main hazard of pneumatic tools?
A: Getting hit by a tool attachment or by a fastener the worker is using with the tool.

Q: What precautions should be taken with air hoses on pneumatic tools?
A: Take the same precautions with an air hose that you take with electric cords.

Q: What types of tools are pneumatic tools?
A: Powered by compressed air. Includes nailers, staplers, chippers, drills, and sanders.

Q: How should pneumatic tools be fastened to the hose?
A: Ensure tool is fastened securely to the hose to prevent a disconnection.

Q: What device should be used to attach the air hose to pneumatic tools?
A: Use a short wire or positive locking device attaching the air hose to the tool.

Q: When must a safety device be placed on the muzzle of a pneumatic tool?
A: Place a safety device on the muzzle to prevent the tool from ejecting fasteners, unless the muzzle is in contact with work surface.

Q: What should be installed to prevent ejection from pneumatic tools?
A: Install a safety clip or retainer to prevent attachments, such as chisels on a chipping hammer, from being ejected.

Q: What PPE is required for pneumatic tools?
A: Wear eye protection and hearing protection with jackhammers.

Q: Is compressed air allowed for cleaning?
A: Do not use compressed air for cleaning.

Q: What is the exception for using compressed air for cleaning?

Q: What PPE is required for powder-actuated tools?
A: Wear suitable ear, eye, and face protection.

Q: How should powder level be selected for powder-actuated tools?
A: Select a powder level that will do the work without excessive force.

Q: What should you avoid driving into when using powder-actuated tools?
A: Materials easily penetrated unless backed by a substance that prevents the pin or fastener from passing through; also avoid very hard or brittle materials that might chip, splatter, or make fasteners ricochet.

Q: When should you NOT use powder-actuated tools?
A: In explosive or flammable atmospheres.
