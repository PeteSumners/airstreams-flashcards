How many deaths and injuries do electrical hazards cause in the workplace each year?	More than 300 deaths and 4,000 injuries.
What rank do electrical accidents hold among all causes of work-related deaths in the United States?	Sixth among all causes of work-related deaths.
What are the six types of electrical hazards that expose workers to serious workplace hazards?	Burns, electrocution, shock, arc flash/arc blast, fire, and explosions.
What four common electrical hazards exist in construction?	Contact with overhead power lines, contact with energized sources/live parts/bare conductors, improper use of extension cords and flexible cords, and improper grounding.
What OSHA regulation covers installation safety requirements for the construction industry?	29 CFR Subpart K, 1926.402 through 1926.408.
What are overhead power lines typically described as?	Un-insulated.
What can contact with overhead power lines cause?	Fatal electrocution and falls from heights.
What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines up to 50 kV?	10 feet.
What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines >50 to 200 kV?	15 feet.
What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines >200 to 350 kV?	20 feet.
What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines >350 to 500 kV?	25 feet.
What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines >500 to 750 kV?	35 feet.
What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines >750 to 1,000 kV?	45 feet.
What happens when the body is wetter or has more moisture?	The lower the resistance and the easier it is for the current to pass through the body.
What is a ground in electrical terms?	A conducting connection (whether or not unintentional) between an electrical circuit or equipment and the earth, or to some conducting body that serves in place of the earth.
What does OSHA require construction sites to create before equipment and tools are energized?	An Assured Equipment Grounding Conductor Program (AEGCP).
What does GFCI stand for and what does it do?	Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter - a receptacle with overcurrent protection capabilities.
What is the typical amp rating for a circuit breaker at a house?	15 amps.
What happens to fuses when blown due to an overcurrent?	They must be replaced (unlike circuit breakers which can be reset unless damaged).
When must extension cords be inspected?	Before each use.
What must be done if a third grounding prong on extension cords cannot be removed?	The tool must be identified as a double insulated tool prior to use.
What must be done if a cord or plug fails inspection?	It must be tagged and taken out of service.
Should you carry a tool by the cord?	Never carry a tool by the cord.
Should you yank the cord to disconnect power tools?	Never yank the cord to disconnect it.
Should power tools be used in wet/damp environments?	No, don't use in wet/damp environments.
According to OSHA construction standards, how must flexible cords be rated per the NEC?	Flexible cords must be rated for hard use and extra hard use, per NEC (National Electric Code).
What voltage threshold requires equipment to be accessible only to authorized workers?	Equipment at 50 volts and higher accessible to authorized workers only.
What communication method should workers be trained on for electrical work?	4-way communication.
What should workers do before touching circuit components and conductors?	Hot-Cold-Hot procedure.
What does LOTO stand for in safety-related work practices?	Lockout Tagout.
