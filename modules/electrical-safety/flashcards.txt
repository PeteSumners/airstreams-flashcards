ELECTRICAL HAZARDS
================================================================================

Q: What percentage of the U.S. workforce is construction, and what percentage of occupational fatalities does it account for?
A: Approximately 8% of the U.S. workforce, yet accounts for 44% of occupational fatalities.

Q: How many deaths and injuries do electrical hazards cause in the workplace each year?
A: More than 300 deaths and 4,000 injuries.

Q: What rank do electrical accidents hold among all causes of work-related deaths in the United States?
A: Sixth among all causes of work-related deaths.

Q: What are the six types of electrical hazards that expose workers to serious workplace hazards?
A: Burns, electrocution, shock, arc flash/arc blast, fire, and explosions.

Q: What four common electrical hazards exist in construction?
A: Contact with overhead power lines, contact with energized sources/live parts/bare conductors, improper use of extension cords and flexible cords, and improper grounding.

Q: What OSHA regulation covers installation safety requirements for the construction industry?
A: 29 CFR Subpart K, 1926.402 through 1926.408.

Q: What are overhead power lines typically described as?
A: Un-insulated.

Q: What can contact with overhead power lines cause?
A: Fatal electrocution and falls from heights.

Q: What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines up to 50 kV?
A: 10 feet.

Q: What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines >50 to 200 kV?
A: 15 feet.

Q: What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines >200 to 350 kV?
A: 20 feet.

Q: What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines >350 to 500 kV?
A: 25 feet.

Q: What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines >500 to 750 kV?
A: 35 feet.

Q: What is the minimum clearance distance for overhead power lines >750 to 1,000 kV?
A: 45 feet.

Q: What happens when the body is wetter or has more moisture?
A: The lower the resistance and the easier it is for the current to pass through the body.

Q: What is a ground in electrical terms?
A: A conducting connection (whether or not unintentional) between an electrical circuit or equipment and the earth, or to some conducting body that serves in place of the earth.

Q: What does OSHA require construction sites to create before equipment and tools are energized?
A: An Assured Equipment Grounding Conductor Program (AEGCP).

Q: What does GFCI stand for and what does it do?
A: Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter - a receptacle with overcurrent protection capabilities.

Q: What is the typical amp rating for a circuit breaker at a house?
A: 15 amps.

Q: What happens to fuses when blown due to an overcurrent?
A: They must be replaced (unlike circuit breakers which can be reset unless damaged).

Q: When must extension cords be inspected?
A: Before each use.

Q: What must be done if a third grounding prong on extension cords cannot be removed?
A: The tool must be identified as a double insulated tool prior to use.

Q: What must be done if a cord or plug fails inspection?
A: It must be tagged and taken out of service.

Q: Should you carry a tool by the cord?
A: Never carry a tool by the cord.

Q: Should you yank the cord to disconnect power tools?
A: Never yank the cord to disconnect it.

Q: Should power tools be used in wet/damp environments?
A: No, don't use in wet/damp environments.

Q: According to OSHA construction standards, how must flexible cords be rated per the NEC?
A: Flexible cords must be rated for hard use and extra hard use, per NEC (National Electric Code).

Q: What voltage threshold requires equipment to be accessible only to authorized workers?
A: Equipment at 50 volts and higher accessible to authorized workers only.

Q: What communication method should workers be trained on for electrical work?
A: 4-way communication.

Q: What should workers do before touching circuit components and conductors?
A: Hot-Cold-Hot procedure.

Q: What does LOTO stand for in safety-related work practices?
A: Lockout Tagout.
