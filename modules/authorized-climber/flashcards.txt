=== MODULE 1: FALL PROTECTION METHODS ===

Q: What is hazard elimination and why is it the preferred method of fall protection?
A: Hazard elimination is the preferred method of fall protection. It removes the need for the worker to leave the ground, thereby eliminating the worker from the potential fall hazard. It keeps workers on the ground, requires no fall protection training, eliminates need for rescue, and saves money in the long run.

Q: What is passive fall protection?
A: Passive fall protection provides a physical barrier between the worker and the potential fall hazard. Examples include guardrails, covers, and hatches.

Q: What is a primary and secondary system in fall protection?
A: The primary system is the first means of support for the worker. The secondary system will activate or function if the primary system fails.

Q: What is a fall restraint system?
A: A fall restraint system is a system that will allow the worker to reach the leading edge, but a fall should never occur. The system consists of a full body harness and some type of energy absorbing capability.

Q: What are the typical anchor requirements for a fall restraint system?
A: Certified anchor: twice the foreseeable forces (ANSI Z359.2); Non-certified anchor: 1,000 Lbs.; User weight: 130-310 Lbs.

Q: What is a Personal Fall Arrest System (PFAS)?
A: A system that allows for a fall to occur. It is designed to distribute the forces to the body over a predetermined length. The system consists of a full body harness and some type of system with energy absorbing capabilities. User weight is 130-310 Lbs.

Q: What factors must be considered when using a PFAS?
A: User weight (130-310 Lbs.), anchor location, strength, swing fall and free fall distance, clearance requirements (structure below, distance to ground), and rescue plan.

Q: What is administrative control in fall protection and when is it used?
A: Administrative controls is the least preferred method of fall protection. This method typically consists of warning lines and safety monitoring systems. To implement administrative controls, all other means of fall protection must be exhausted and must involve the use of a qualified person involved in writing the administrative procedures.

Q: What are three examples of administrative controls?
A: Warning line systems, controlled access zones, and safety monitors.

A: Wind and Telecom harness.

Q: How often should harnesses be inspected by a competent person/safety on-site?
A: Harnesses should be inspected annually by the competent person/safety on-site and documented. The frequency of inspection will be dependent on use.

Q: When must a harness be removed from service?
A: Remove harnesses immediately after a fall or if any components fail inspection to ensure user safety. Additionally, tag equipment that was deemed unsafe.

Q: When should an authorized person inspect a harness?
A: Harnesses shall be inspected by the end-user or authorized person at the beginning of each shift or if deemed necessary.

Q: What are the five points to check during the 5-point buddy check for donning a full body harness?
A: Dorsal D-ring, shoulder & chest straps (sternal d-ring), sub pelvic strap, leg loops, and overall fit.

Q: Where should the dorsal D-ring be positioned on a properly fitted harness according to ANSI Z359.11?
A: The dorsal D-ring should be positioned between the shoulder blades, typically at the center of the back. It should be accessible and properly aligned, not too low or too high on the back.

Q: Where should the chest strap be positioned on a properly fitted harness?
A: The chest strap should be positioned across the sternum at the mid-chest level, typically around the collarbone area.

Q: How should shoulder straps be adjusted on a full body harness?
A: The shoulder straps should be adjusted so they fit snugly but allow for comfortable movement. They should not be too tight, restricting movement, or too loose, which can compromise safety.

Q: How should the sub-pelvic strap be adjusted on a full body harness?
A: Adjust the strap so that it is tight enough to prevent it from slipping down during movement, but not so tight that it causes discomfort or restricts circulation. A good rule of thumb is to be able to fit a flat hand between the strap and your body without excessive looseness.

Q: What are the D-ring locations and their uses on a full body harness?
A: Back: Dorsal D-Ring for Fall Restraint & Fall Arrest; Suspended work positioning D-Rings on sides; Suspension Seat; Front: Chest/Sternal D-Ring for Fall Arrest; Side D-Rings for Positioning; Leg straps.

Q: What is "rollout" in the context of connector use and how can it be prevented?
A: Rollout occurs when the load on the connector causes it to disengage or fail. Two ways to prevent this are by using overhead connections and flexibility.

Q: Must a harness be 100% on the body or completely off?
A: True. The harness should be 100% on the body or taken off completely.

A: Suspension trauma refers to the physical effects that occur when a person is suspended in a harness after a fall. This condition can lead to unconsciousness or even death if the person remains suspended for an extended period. It arises from reduced blood flow, particularly to the brain, due to the position of the body while hanging.

Q: What should be done to mitigate suspension trauma risks?
A: To mitigate the risks of suspension trauma, it's crucial to implement rescue plans and ensure that workers are trained to recognize the signs and take action promptly if suspension occurs.

A: The ANSI Z359.3 standard defines the supine position as a horizontal position where a person lies flat on their back. This position is significant in fall protection and rescue operations, as it helps reduce the risk of suspension trauma after a fall. In a rescue scenario, placing a suspended individual in the supine position can facilitate better blood circulation and decrease the likelihood of serious physiological effects.
