RESPIRATOR FIT-TESTING
RESPIRATOR FIT-TESTING
================================================================================
How often must respirator fit-testing be conducted?	Annually (must be conducted annually).
What are the two types of fit-testing?	Qualitative (relies on the wearer to identify whether they can smell or taste the hazardous agent) and quantitative (provides a number called a fit factor, identifies the quality of the fit).
What does voluntary use of respirators require employers to give users?	Appendix D (employee information when respirators are not required).
