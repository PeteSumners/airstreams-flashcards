HAZARDOUS MATERIALS - RIGHT TO KNOW
================================================================================

Q: What did OSHA create to help ensure safety when working with hazardous chemicals?
A: The Hazard Communication Standard.

Q: What is the "right to know"?
A: You have a RIGHT TO KNOW about the hazardous chemicals you use on the job and how to work safely with those chemicals.

Q: What are the two main categories of chemical hazards?
A: Physical hazards (flammable, explosive, reactive) and health hazards (corrosive, toxic).



================================================================================
SAFETY DATA SHEETS (SDS)
SAFETY DATA SHEETS (SDS)
================================================================================

Q: What must Safety Data Sheets include regarding chemical identity?
A: Chemical and manufacturer identity, hazardous ingredients, physical and chemical characteristics, fire/explosion/reactivity information.

Q: What exposure limit abbreviation stands for Permissible Exposure Limit?
A: PEL.

Q: What exposure limit abbreviation stands for Threshold Limit Value?
A: TLV.

Q: What health information must SDSs include?
A: Routes of entry, exposure levels, symptoms of exposure, first-aid and emergency information, PPE requirements, safe handling and storage, spills and leaks, and compliance issues.



================================================================================
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FIRST AID
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FIRST AID
================================================================================

Q: What is the basic first aid for eye exposure to hazardous materials?
A: Flush with water for 15 minutes.

Q: What is the basic first aid for skin exposure to hazardous materials?
A: Wash with soap and water.

Q: What is the basic first aid for inhalation of hazardous materials?
A: Move to fresh air.

Q: What is the basic first aid for swallowing hazardous materials?
A: Get emergency medical assistance.



================================================================================
CHEMICAL HAZARDS - ROUTES OF ENTRY
CHEMICAL HAZARDS - ROUTES OF ENTRY
================================================================================

Q: What are the four routes of entry for chemical hazards?
A: Skin and eye contact, inhalation, swallowing, and penetration (skin absorption).



================================================================================
HAZARD COMMUNICATION STANDARD
HAZARD COMMUNICATION STANDARD
================================================================================

Q: What must chemical manufacturers do under the Hazard Communication Standard?
A: Determine a chemical's hazards and provide labels and SDSs.

Q: What must employers do under the Hazard Communication Standard?
A: Provide a hazard communication program, maintain safety data sheets (SDS), and train on hazardous materials.



================================================================================
LABELS
LABELS
================================================================================

Q: What information must labels include?
A: The identity of the chemical, name/address/emergency phone number of the manufacturer, physical and health hazards, special handling instructions, basic PPE recommendations, and first aid/fire response/spill cleanup information.



================================================================================
NFPA LABELING SYSTEM
NFPA LABELING SYSTEM
================================================================================

Q: In the NFPA labeling system, what does blue represent?
A: Health hazard.

Q: In the NFPA labeling system, what does red represent?
A: Flammability.

Q: In the NFPA labeling system, what does yellow represent?
A: Reactivity.

Q: In the NFPA labeling system, what does white represent?
A: Other hazards or special handling.

Q: What is the NFPA hazard rating scale?
A: 0 (No Hazard) to 4 (Extreme Hazard).



================================================================================
SPILLS AND LEAKS
SPILLS AND LEAKS
================================================================================

Q: What are the four steps when you spot a leak?
A: Evacuate the area, notify a supervisor or the emergency response team, remove ignition sources (if safe to do so), and stay away.



================================================================================
PPE FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
PPE FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
================================================================================

Q: What types of PPE are used for handling hazardous materials?
A: Dust masks and respirators, glasses/goggles/face shields, hearing protection, gloves, foot protection, head protection, and aprons or full-body suits.



================================================================================
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION
================================================================================

Q: What OSHA standard covers respiratory protection?
A: 29 CFR 1910.134.

Q: What does 29 CFR 1910.134 require?
A: A written program, employee training, medical evaluation, and fit-testing.

Q: What must respiratory protection programs use?
A: NIOSH-approved respirators only.

Q: What are the two main categories of respiratory protection?
A: Air purifying (gas and vapor, particulate, combination) and atmosphere supplying (SCBA - self-contained breathing apparatus, SARs - supplied-air respirators).



================================================================================
RESPIRATOR FIT-TESTING
RESPIRATOR FIT-TESTING
================================================================================

Q: How often must respirator fit-testing be conducted?
A: Annually (must be conducted annually).

Q: What are the two types of fit-testing?
A: Qualitative (relies on the wearer to identify whether they can smell or taste the hazardous agent) and quantitative (provides a number called a fit factor, identifies the quality of the fit).

Q: What does voluntary use of respirators require employers to give users?
A: Appendix D (employee information when respirators are not required).



================================================================================
DUSTS AND FIBERS IN CONSTRUCTION
DUSTS AND FIBERS IN CONSTRUCTION
================================================================================

Q: What are five examples of dusts and fibers found in construction?
A: Crystalline silica, asbestos, metal dusts, lead-based paint, and fiberglass.

CRYSTALLINE SILICA
================================================================================

Q: What forms does crystalline silica come in?
A: Quartz (silicone and oxygen), sand, gravel, clay, granite, and other forms of rock.

Q: What health condition can result from inhaling smaller particles of crystalline silica deep into the lungs?
A: Silicosis (leading to silicosis).



================================================================================
