        question: "Why should you \"get low and go\" during a fire evacuation?",
        answer: "Smoke rises - staying low keeps you in the least smoke-filled area with better visibility. Heat rises - temperatures near the ceiling can be hundreds of degrees higher than on the floor. Fresh, cooler air usually comes in at the lowest levels."
